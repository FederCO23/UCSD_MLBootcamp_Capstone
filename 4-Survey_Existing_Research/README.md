# Step 4: Survey Existing Research

This repository contains the objectives for the **Step 2 â€“ Collect Your Data** Capstone Submission.

As part of my learning process, I ran several notebooks from public repositories featuring different semantic segmentation models and techniques. These experiments helped me capture ideas, understand best practices, and gain hands-on experience in running and evaluating these models.

The following notebooks were explored:


- [Notebook 1 - Brazil Data Cube Data Access](./'Inference Demo.ipynb')
	source repo: https://github.com/microsoft/solar-farms-mapping
	An Artificial Intelligence Dataset for Solar Energy Locations in India

- [Notebook 2 - Google Earth Engine Data Access](./GEE_EDA.ipynb)

- [Notebook 1 - Brazil Data Cube Data Access](./BDC_EDA.ipynb)

- [Notebook 2 - Google Earth Engine Data Access](./GEE_EDA.ipynb)

    Brief description of what it covers.

These explorations contributed valuable insights into model architectures, training strategies, and evaluation techniques, which I plan to apply and refine in my own projects.
