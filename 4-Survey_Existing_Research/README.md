# Step 4: Survey Existing Research

As part of my learning process, I explored several notebooks from public repositories that feature various semantic segmentation models and techniques. These experiments allowed me to capture ideas, understand best practices, and gain hands-on experience in running and evaluating these models.

The following notebooks were explored:

- [Notebook 1 - solar-farms-mapping](./InferenceDemo.ipynb)
	An artificial intelligence dataset for identifying solar energy locations in India.
	source repo: https://github.com/microsoft/solar-farms-mapping
	

- [Notebook 2 - Large-scale-solar-plant-monitoring](./PVNotebook.ipynb)
	This repository supports the paper "Remote Sensing for Monitoring of Photovoltaic Power Plants in Brazil Using Deep Semantic Segmentation", which is currently submitted to Energies (MDPI).
	source repo: https://github.com/osmarluiz/Large-scale-solar-plant-monitoring


- [Notebook 3 - Satellite_ComputerVision](./UNET_G4G_2019_solar.ipynb)
	A UNET-based model trained by the Chesapeake Conservancy to detect and delineate ground-mounted solar arrays from Sentinel-2 imagery. The model aims to support mapping solar energy infrastructure across several eastern U.S. states (DE, MD, PA, NY, VA, WV, etc.).
	source repo: https://github.com/mjevans26/Satellite_ComputerVision

	
- [Notebook 4 - segmentation models](./binary_segmentation_camvid.ipynb)
	 A comprehensive and popular library for semantic segmentation that includes various models and encoders. Available for both TensorFlow and PyTorch.
	source repo: https://github.com/qubvel-org/segmentation_models.pytorch

These explorations contributed valuable insights into model architectures, training strategies, and evaluation techniques, which I plan to apply and refine in my own projects.
