## 1. Introduction

Welcome to my Capstone Project repository for the UCSD Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp, mentored by Artem Yankov (Google). This project aims to develop an **end-to-end ML pipeline for the automatic detection of photovoltaic (PV) power stations** using satellite imagery and deep learning via semantic segmentation.

### Context
Solar energy is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources worldwide, especially in regions like Brazil‚Äîwhere vast areas of land are suitable for solar projects. However, tracking and mapping new installations through traditional methods (e.g., manual surveys or scattered records) can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This gap calls for a **scalable, automated approach** to accurately identify solar power stations, aiding **resource planning, policy-making, and environmental impact assessments**.

Beyond this practical need, a key motivation for this project is my own **curiosity and desire to deepen my understanding** of image detection models from both academic and real-world perspectives. By applying advanced deep learning techniques to real satellite imagery, I aim to **bridge theoretical knowledge** with **hands-on technological implementation**, contributing to the broader landscape of computer vision applications.

### Objectives
1. **Create a dataset** from scratch using open-source satellite imagery curated for PV power station detection.  
2. **Define a baseline model** to establish initial performance benchmarks.  
3. **Develop a deep learning model** to identify solar plants across Brazil using satellite data.  
4. **Test multiple popular model architectures** (e.g., U-Net, U-Net++, DeepLabV3, PSPNet, and FPN).  
5. **Enhance performance** using image preprocessing techniques such as Bicubic Interpolation and **Enhanced Super Resolution GANs (ESRGAN)**.  
6. **Design an end-to-end pipeline**, encompassing data ingestion, model training, evaluation, and deployment.  
7. **Deploy** the solution in a manner that can be demonstrated or integrated into real-world systems.

## 2. Highlights

Here are a few key points:

### A. [Brazil Data Cube](https://data.inpe.br/bdc/web/en/home-page-2/) <img src="./2-EDA/sup_images/logo-bdc.png" align="right" width="64" />
We use open images from the Sentinel-2 program available at Brazil Data Cube, which is a research, development, and technological innovation project of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Brazil. It produces datasets from large volumes of medium-resolution remote sensing images for the entire national territory. The project also develops a computational platform to process and analyze these datasets using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and image time series analysis.

### B. Dataset Creation <img src="./img/qgis-logo.png" align="right" width="100" />
We created a dataset from scratch with **272 images** coming from **16 photovoltaic plants** of various distributions, sizes, and surroundings, aiming for good generalization. To expand our samples, we captured multiple random scenes over each plant and applied **data augmentation** to reduce overfitting.

| **Sets**    | **Number of Areas** | **Number of Images** |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Training    |         11          |       201 (74%)     |
| Validation  |          2          |        27 (10%)     |
| Test        |          3          |        44 (16%)     |

Labeling was performed using an ad-hoc ‚Äúauto-mask‚Äù script, followed by manual edits in QGIS.

### C. Performance Achieved
We achieved the following metrics: **IoU = 94.62%** and **F1-Score = 97.23%**, using a U-Net model pre-trained on ImageNet with an EfficientNet-B7 encoder. We also applied **bicubic interpolation** (2√ó scaling) to improve resolution.

### E. Customized Loss Function
We obtained our best results using a **weighted loss function** composed of:
- **Binary Cross Entropy**
- **Focal Loss**
- **Jaccard Index**

We also experimented with **Dice Loss**, but found the above combination to yield better performance overall.
